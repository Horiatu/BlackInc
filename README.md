# BlackInc

Aren't you tired of those web pages with gray and light text on white?

Aren't you tired of the bright light at night which hurts your eyes?

Use this extension to turn the ink of text on the page to Black, Blue or Red. Enhance light fonts to bold if you wish.

Add a Pink or Invert filter to protect your eyes from the bright blueish white background color.

Turn with easy those options with shortcut keys once you've activated the extension.
